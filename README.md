# Application Security pipelines

# What is it for 

## Summary

This open-source framework is designed for application security managers and engineers to increase the speed of integration of security practices into the development lifecycle.

Here you may see the process demonstration:

## Requirements

### Engeneering

Systems: 
- [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) (to manage vulnerabilities)
- [Metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase) (for metrics)
- GitLab (for pipelines)

### Management

People: 1 engineer + 1 manager

Time: 2 weeks for technical integration if all systems exist and the network access is granted

Risks: 
- Vulnerabilities will not be fixed without agreement with the business team that reducing the WRT metric is one of its goals
- You may have so many vulnerabilities in your code base that you would need another security engineer to verify them
